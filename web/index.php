                   Machine learning is an umbrella term for several families of statistical or other techniques 
                   that can be programmed to analyze data and make predictions. In most cases, a machine 
                   learning algorithm can be looked at as a black box into which data is fed. In the beginning, 
                   the black box is "trained" on pre-existing data, and when that phase is complete, the goal 
                   is to have it able to discover patterns and/or make predictions about future data.

                <h4>What Should I Know First?</h4>
                <p>Technically, you can write decent machine learning code without much prerequisite knowledge by 
                   using various libraries such as scikit-learn. If you want to do anything very customized, then 
                   the amount of knowledge you'll need jumps up. Depending on what exactly you want to do, you 
                   may first need to know the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An appropriate language - there are many ML libraries for Python and R</li>
                    <li>Multivariable calculus</li>
                    <li>Linear algebra</li>
                    <li>Statistics</li>
                    <li>Probability</li>
                    <li>Discrete math optional, but useful</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h4>Where Can I Go To Learn More?</h4>
                <p>The David O. McKay library has plenty of books on machine learning. There are also many 
                   videos on Youtube with tutorials about various ML algorithms, with various degrees of
                   detail, complexity, and difficulty. A channel I love is called 3Blue1Brown.</p>
