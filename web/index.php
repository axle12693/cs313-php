                <h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
                <p>Machine learning is an umbrella term for several families of statistical or other techniques 
                   that can be programmed to analyze data and make predictions. In most cases, a machine 
                   learning algorithm can be looked at as a black box into which data is fed. In the beginning, 
                   the black box is "trained" on pre-existing data, and when that phase is complete, the goal 
                   is to have it able to discover patterns and/or make predictions about future data.</p>
